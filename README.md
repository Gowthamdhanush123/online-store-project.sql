### üõçÔ∏è **Project Title: Online Store Management System (SQL Database Project)**

**Project Description:**
The *Online Store Management System* is a database-driven application designed to manage the operations of an e-commerce platform efficiently. The project focuses on using **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to design, implement, and query a relational database that handles various aspects of an online store ‚Äî including products, customers, orders, payments, inventory, and suppliers.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a **normalized relational database** that ensures data integrity, minimizes redundancy, and provides fast and accurate data retrieval for store management tasks. The system enables administrators to manage product listings, track customer orders, monitor stock levels, record transactions, and generate business reports.

**Key Features:**

* **Product Management:** Store details such as product name, category, price, stock quantity, and supplier information.
* **Customer Management:** Maintain customer profiles including contact details, order history, and payment preferences.
* **Order Processing:** Handle order creation, payment tracking, shipping status, and invoice generation.
* **Inventory Control:** Automatically update stock levels after each sale and generate low-stock alerts.
* **Reporting and Analytics:** Generate SQL reports for sales trends, most purchased items, and customer activity.

**Database Design:**
The database includes the following main entities (tables):

* `Customers (CustomerID, Name, Email, Phone, Address)`
* `Products (ProductID, Name, Category, Price, Stock, SupplierID)`
* `Suppliers (SupplierID, Name, ContactInfo)`
* `Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, PaymentStatus)`
* `OrderDetails (OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, UnitPrice)`
* `Payments (PaymentID, OrderID, PaymentMethod, PaymentDate, Amount)`

**SQL Components Used:**

* **DDL:** CREATE, ALTER, DROP statements to define and manage tables.
* **DML:** INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE for data manipulation.
* **DQL:** SELECT queries with JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions for report generation.
* **Constraints:** Primary keys, foreign keys, unique, check, and not-null constraints for data integrity.
* **Views, Triggers, and Stored Procedures** for automation and efficient data retrieval.

**Expected Outcome:**
A fully functional SQL database capable of supporting an online store‚Äôs day-to-day operations, providing insights through data queries, and serving as the backend for a potential web or desktop front-end application.
